# How this works on Pantheon site 

## Setup a Drupal system with custom content types based on Organization departments

### Create views for all the above content types where records can be listed with option to sort by creation date, name, price etc. Add a range filter to drill down records created between certain dates and a category filter for the Production list view page.

#### Create roles and attach to content types such that, no one can edit/delete other departments' data, the view can be public.

#### Add-on: create a workflow for sending emails to the sales head when a new quote is generated from sales team.
